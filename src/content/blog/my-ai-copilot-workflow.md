Few month ago, I tried ChatGPT for the first time. The AI's response suprised me. After a deep research I decided to intergrate it into my workflow. I think this is good tool to help personal organize huge amount of information. 

The past year, I always think Google is the best tool to get any information for me. I think only I need is Google search I can get all I need. But I found later that it is not easy get instance knowledge from google, becasue google give you the related web page, i need speed more time to research and anaylyze the information.

Last year, I try learn to use note to organize my information. I try to Emacs org-mode to build a second brain for me. But I found it is not easy to use org-mode to organize my information. I need to spend a lot of time to learn Emacs org-mode. And after I take thounds of notes, I missed. I can not get the information or knowledge instantedlly. And also i do not know what information should i copy to notes. Finnally, I think it is not a good tool for me.

So, when I first tast ChatGPT, I know I need a AI assistant to help organize all my information and knowledge. I think it is a good tool to help me to get the information I need. And I think it is a good tool to help me to organize my information and knowledge.

Though, ChatGPT can not help me to organize my information and knowledge. But it can help me to get the information I need. And it can help me to get the knowledge I need. I think it is a good tool to help me to get the information and knowledge I need.

## Workflow

I decided to make a web application to interact with GPT api. The good news is OpenAI release the newest GPT-3.5-Turbo ChatCompletion API. It is super cheap. This make build a application by the API possible.

I decided to use the following workflow to use ChatGPT.

1. I use the following command to get the information I need.

```bash
$ chatgpt "what is the best tool to get information?"
```
